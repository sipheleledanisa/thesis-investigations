# Thesis Investigations
This code-base is adapted from [Wen et al.'s](https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.09207) work, and our own work first implements different samplers for MASQL, and these implementations are 
found in scripts labelled as masql_+sampler_name.py in the 'code/maci/learners' directory. Secondly, the MI algorithm/learner class is found in the 
same directory under mi_ac.py, and has a run-file in '...code/experiment'. A more detailed README about the codebase can be found in the code folder. This includes instructions on how to 
install packages and / or run scripts.
